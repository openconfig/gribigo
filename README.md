This repository contains a [gRIBI](https://github.com/openconfig/gribi)
client and in-memory server, written in Go, which serves as a reference
implementation for the gRIBI protocol.

In addition, the `fluent/` directory contains a human-readable API for use in
writing functional tests against a gRIBI server. This API is designed for use intest frameworks such as [ONDATRA](https://github.com/openconfig/ondatra). The
fluent-style API is a test-only library.

**Note**: This is not an official Google product.
