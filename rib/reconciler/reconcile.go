// Package reconciler reconciles the contents of two gRIBI RIBs -- the intended RIB
// is assumed to contain the desired RIB entries, whereas the 'target' RIB is to be
// programmed. The reconciler:
//
//   - Uses the messages that are returned from the `Get` RPC to build the contents of
//     an external RIB.
//   - Calculates a diff between the two RIBs.
//   - Sends gRIBI operations to the target RIB to make it consistent with the
//     intended RIB.
